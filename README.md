# rizato's dotfiles

Configuration files, mostly for easy personal access.

## Installation

Simply run `make install`, which will create symlinks to the configuration files
in the repository in your home directory. A corresponding `make uninstall` is
included which will remove the files in this repository from your home directory
if they are symlinks. Conflicts with existing dotfiles are detected by stow.

## Vim Plugins
