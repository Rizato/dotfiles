Configuration files, mostly for easy personal access.

## Installation

Simply run `make install`, which will create symlinks to the configuration files
in the repository in your home directory. **This destructively updates the
configuration files already in your home directory, use with caution**. A
corresponding `make uninstall` is included which will remove the files in this
repository from your home directory if they are symlinks. Backups of the
original files are not currently maintained.

## Vim Plugins

Vim plugins are managed by [Plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug).
